    <string id="KFMOptInWithWizard_help">This setting displays the "Your IT department wants you to protect your important folders" window that prompts users to move their Documents, Pictures, and Desktop folders to OneDrive. This feature is not enabled for on-premises SharePoint.

If you enable this setting and provide your tenant ID, users who are syncing their OneDrive will see the "Your IT department wants you to protect your important folders" window when they're signed in. If they close the window, a reminder notification will appear in the activity center until they move all three known folders. If a user has already redirected their known folders to a different OneDrive account, they will be prompted to direct the folders to the account for your organization (leaving existing files behind).

If you disable or do not configure this setting, the "Your IT department wants you to protect your important folders" window won't appear automatically.</string>

    <string id="KFMOptInNoWizard_help">This setting lets you redirect known folders to OneDrive without any user interaction. In sync app builds below 18.171.0823.0001, this setting only redirects empty known folders to OneDrive (or known folders already redirected to a different OneDrive account). In later builds, it redirects known folders that contain content and moves the content to OneDrive. We recommend using this setting together with "Prompt users to move Windows known folders to OneDrive." If moving the known folders silently does not succeed, users will be prompted to correct the error and continue.

If you enable this setting and provide your tenant ID, you can choose whether to display a notification to users after their folders have been redirected.

You can move all folders at once or select the folders you want to move.  After a folder is moved, this policy will not affect that folder again, even if you clear the check box for the folder.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, your users' known folders will not be silently redirected and/or moved to OneDrive.
