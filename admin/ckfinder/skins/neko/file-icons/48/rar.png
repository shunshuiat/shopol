at indicates other TCP connections are consuming bandwidth, the sync app will reduce its own consumption to prevent interference. When network latency decreases again and bandwidth is freed up, the sync app will increase the upload rate and consume the unused bandwidth.

If you enable this setting, the sync app upload rate will be set to "Adjust automatically" based on bandwidth availability and users won't be able to change it.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, users can choose to limit the upload rate to a fixed value (in KB/second), or set it to "Adjust automatically".

Important
If you enable or disable this setting, and then change it back to Not Configured, the last configuration will remain in effect. We recommend enabling this setting instead of "Limit the sync app upload speed to a fixed rate." You should not enable both settings at the same time. This setting will override "Limit the sync app upload rate to a percentage of throughput" if both are enabled on the same device.</string>
