If you enable this setting, known folders will be provisioned using the user's Windows display language, even if the user sets a different preferred language.

If you disable or do not configure this setting, and the user set a preferred language, their known folders will be provisioned in OneDrive using that language. The known folders on their PC will appear in their preferred language.</string>
